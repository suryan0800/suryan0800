- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud architecture, docker.

- 📫 I can be reach via mail (suryan0800@gmail.com) or linkedin (suryan0800)

  I may sound like I listed all the technologies I know/heard of. But, I mentioned coding and hackaton because I have participated in some competitions. I mentioned Python, ML because I have done some mini learning projects on them. I mentioned Cloud and Network because I have done some courses and hands-on on them. Technologies is too generic to mention. But, I like to learn new technology framework, architecture. I also admire new technologies like blockchain, cloud etc.
